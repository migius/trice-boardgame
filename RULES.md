## Setup
1. Place the card between the two players
1. Every player rolls 6 dice, the player with most 6s is the first player, in case of tie, with most 5s, 4s...
1. The second player choose a die for the first player, __don't change the die value__

## Game Flow
The first player places the die chosen by the opponent in a free square on the card, there are no placement restrictions. After placement: if a _Trice_ is created the player who placed the die wins the game immediately or if a _Double Trice_ is created he loses immediately.  
If no _Trice_ is created the player who placed the die chooses another die for the opponent and a new turn begins.
### Board completed
If the board is complete the player that places the last die must indicate a die on the board. For his next turn, the other player must swap the chosen die with one adjacent die. After that he must increment the value of one of the swapped die by one (a 6 becomes 1), and check if he makes a _Trice_ **only after the value change**. If so, the game ends immediately. The game will continue with this rule until a player makes a _Trice_.

## End of the game
When a player makes a _Trice_ on the board the game ends immediately and the player who placed the die wins. If a player makes a _Double Trice_ he loses immediately.

## _Trice_
A _Trice_ is composed of three dice horizontally, vertically or diagonally aligned with __only__ one of these conditions:
* same color
* same value
* ordered value (e.g. 2, 3, 4)

### _Double Trice_
If there are __two__ conditions in the same three dice the player loses immediately.
