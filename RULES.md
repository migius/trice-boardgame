## Setup
1. Place the card between the two players
1. Every player rolls 6 dice, the player with most 6s is the first player, in case of tie, with most 5s, 4s...
1. The second player choose a die for the first player, __don't change the die value__

## Game Flow
The first player places the die chosen by the opponent in a free square on the card, there are no placement restrictions. After placement: if a _Trice_ is created the player who placed the die wins the game immediately.
If no _Trice_ is created the player who placed the die chooses another die for the opponent and a new turn begins.

## End of the game
When a player makes a _Trice_ on the board the game ends immediately and the player who placed the die wins.  
If a player places the last die without making a _Trice_ the game ends with a tie.

## _Trice_
A _Trice_ is composed by three dice horizontally, vertically or diagonally aligned with __only__ one of these conditions:
* same color
* same value
* ordered value (e.g. 2, 3, 4)
